## Xcode project
The project is generated by a xcodegen.yml spec. This enables you to add the .xcodeproj to your gitignore since the project can easily be deleted and regenerated. Merge conflicts and wrong file paths in your Xcode project are therefore less likely to happen. Just make sure that every change you want to make to your Xcode project is added to this spec. Furthermore xcconfig files are used to make the generated project even more manageable.

Please be aware that running the generated project for the first time might take some time. This is because multiple third party dependencies based on you selection in the setup will be installed in the Xcode Run-Script-Phases. Every consecutive run should be pretty fast.
